# Connected Components in Differential Dataflow (Rust)

Experiments of porting the connected components example from Naiad
(https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/Naiad/blob/release_0.5/Examples/DifferentialDataflow/ConnectedComponents.cs)
to the Rust implementation of Differential Dataflow (https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow). 
 
There is a basic example of connected components
(https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow/blob/master/examples/cc.rs) which this project is using as a
basis, but that is missing some parts of the Naiad example.
